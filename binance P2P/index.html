        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>We have 8 BILLION SOWL Tokens set aside for Game Play Rewards!
            Now, some of you may be asking - what happens if those run out? GREAT QUESTION!
            <br><span style="color:#fff">The answer is called: The SOWL Rewards Replenishment Objective</span>
            <br>Allow us to explain...
            <br>
            <br>We make ACTUAL income from our games. We generate revenue in 2 ways:
            <br><span style="color: #fff">1. Game play</span> (people may lose the game, thus not earning back their tokens)
            <br><span style="color: #fff">2. Ad Revenue</span> (displayed throughout the website and thus earning revenue)
            <br>
            <br>With these 2 sources of income, we take 50% and use it for Token Buy Backs. This not only helps increase the value of SOWL, but we strategically take ALL of the tokens we received in the Buy Backs and put them directly into the Token Rewards wallet! So it is a constant replenishment of the tokens needed for our rewards! So as long as we have people playing the game and looking at ads - we will NEVER run out of tokens! This is something that very few, if any, other P2E games can boast!
            <br>
            <br>Our Executive Committee has created the PERFECT Crypto Ecosystem, using REAL revenue to keep the network going!</p>

        <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
        <P>The SOWL Educational Arcade was built to help us achieve our mission of bringing interactive decentralized education to the entire world. If you have access to the internet, you have access to a fun, high-quality learning environment. We use the central premise of "Gamification" which allows us to build the learning process directly into the actual game play itself. This allows people to learn in an interactive way while also achieving educational milestones via passing test questions and learning through videos and fun facts that are also integrated into game play. Gamification is one of the leading technological innovations that we believe will make the largest impact in education - and we are at the forefront of it. All of our games each have a category of learning so that our users, called "SOWL"diers (soldiers), can choose what they want to learn and have fun with at the same time. Learning at your own pace is something that the Online University model popularized, and we have adopted it into our philosophy as well. Overall, you learn in a fun, fast-paced, integrated, decentralized and on-your-own-time way! We have created the future of eLearning!</P>
        <br>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <P>SOWL Educational Arcade will become the world leader in Decentralized Education by developing fun and interactive games with a gamification-centric focus, by always keeping our users (our SOWLdiers) at the forefront of our minds in everything we build, and by making our standard of excellence a benchmark throughout the Education and Crypto industries.</P>

            <h1>P2E</h1>
            <p>All SOWL Educational Arcade games are P2E, which means "Play 2 Earn." This means that you get paid to learn! That's why our tagline is Learn 2 Earn! Depending on the game, you will get ACTUAL SOWL Tokens for answering test questions correctly and for achieving certain high-score milestones. You truly get paid to learn and to keep learning as the high-score milestones encourage you to keep playing, so even after you've mastered the game, you will still have the ability to earn more SOWL Tokens when reaching certain high-score benchmarks. The test questions are all based on the category of education the game falls in and we have fun facts and educational videos to help you along the way.</p>
